- These excluded dates should be visually distinguishable in the date picker.

- Automatically compute and display the number of days between the chosen dates, excluding the ones marked in the previous step.

### Lead Count Input and Expected Lead Count

- Provide an input field for 'Number of Leads.'
- 'Expected Lead Count' will be derived from the 'Number of Leads' and the number of days from the above step.
